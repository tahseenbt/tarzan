# A basic shell script for searching tar files

A shell script named tarzan.sh which accepts 2 arguments – the name of a file, followed by a tar file’s name. The tar file name maybe passed on using absolute path or relative path. The objective is to inform the user if a particular file is present in a tar file or not, without extracting it. The tar command provides you with an option to list all the contents in the tar file without extracting it.
